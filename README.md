## Implementation

* The App is responsive and looks great In tab as well as mobile view.

* I have added comments whereever possible.
* Redux saga is used and have used react-window to virtualize the updates to the list does not slow down even at high load
* Future scope could be that we can restrict the number of rows in table implement a better data structure and add better CSS.
